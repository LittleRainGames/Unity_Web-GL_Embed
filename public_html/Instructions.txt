For a Full tutorial on how to do this yourself, without these files visit https://www.littleraingames.com/tutorials/unity_webgl_embedding
If you use wordpress or other website builders you may want to follow the tutorial, or atleast find out how to add code to the head of a page.
I do go over both extensivly though.


Build your web GL game in Unity. 
In the folder it creates, replace the file build/UnityLoader.js with public_html/page_with_game/WebGL_Game/Build/UnityLoader.js

Now from the same folder, replace TagetData/styles.css with public_html/page_with_game/WebGL_Game/TagetData/styles.css

Now on the webpage you want to display your game on, open the index.html.
If you look in the example, which is public_html/page_with_game/index.html you will see I added comments.

If you try the example on a local machine it doesn't seem to want to work, but it does work once its uploaded.
Here is the URL to the exact same example https://www.littleraingames.com/tutorials/unity_webgl_embedding/WebGL_example/Page_With_Game/index.html




The ones you want to look for is Head Code, and Page Code.


Copy everything in the Head Code and paste it in your index.html, within the <head> </head>
Now you need to change the URL's to your games files.

Make sure you upload the file public_html/styles/unity_webgl.css to your server, and reference that. 
You could always keep that URL the same, but you may want to change it later.



Now copy the Page Code and paste it where you would like on your site, you should not have to change anything here.


Thats it, your done!
